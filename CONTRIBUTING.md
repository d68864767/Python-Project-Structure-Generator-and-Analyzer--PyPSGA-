# Contributing to Python Project Structure Generator and Analyzer (PyPSGA)

## Where do I go from here?

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork PyPSGA and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localisation
```
